# analyze_wordle_list_analyzer.dev: development version of
# wordle_list_analyzer.zsh: script to tabulate letters in unsolved positions

# answer set

# Developed on macos 16.1 (21.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0: root:xnu-8020.240.7~1/RELEASE_X86_64)
# and zsh (zsh 5.8.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin21.0)

# v0.01 11/24/22 gsb: basic functionality and debugging

# Added so far in this version: proper handling of variables passed from main, list total letter frequency
# of list of remaining answers, not just by position, changed analysis to be based on unused answers

# To be added: change y/n questions not to exit on invalid entry, ...
